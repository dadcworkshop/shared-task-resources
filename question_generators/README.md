# Question Generators

For Track 2, you might want to generate questions to help build your training sets.

As an additional resource, we share access to three question generators used in the works "[Improving Question Answering Model Robustness with Synthetic Adversarial Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08678)" and expanded on in "[Models in the Loop: Aiding Crowdworkers with Generative Annotation Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09062)".

Details for downloading and using the models are avaible here: https://github.com/maxbartolo/synQA-question-generators

If you have any questions related to these models, please contact Max at m.bartolo@ucl.ac.uk.
